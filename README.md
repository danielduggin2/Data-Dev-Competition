# Data-Dev-Competition
South Gibson county High School   Group: Daniel Duggin, Carson Ikerd, and Phillip Russell
Phillip, Carson, and I had a blast creating our website and database. Carson was in charge of the database, phillip was in charge of the CSS on the website, and I was responsible for the creation of our website. Phillip also assisted Carson in the process of making our database. We created our ficticious business with the intnent to win the competition. We stayed the night as each members house to get to know each other better, and to get ahead of schedule on our project. At the beginning of the semester, we set deadlines for ourselves. However, we quickly blew those deadlines out of the water. Overall, we all found a new revived love for coding. We feel like our project is top tier and should be considered to win.
